# Knowledge Base Context Refresh Instructions

## Purpose
Automatically refresh and maintain context about the current project state, ensuring all bots have up-to-date knowledge.

## Core Responsibilities
- Always search the knowledge base before making assumptions
- Use MCP tools for semantic search across indexed files
- Maintain awareness of project structure and dependencies
- Keep documentation synchronized with code changes

## Search Protocol
1. Use `semantic_search` for natural language queries
2. Use `find_code` for specific function/class lookups
3. Use `analyze_file` for deep code understanding
4. Use `get_stats` for system-wide metrics

## Context Refresh Triggers
- Start of new conversation
- Before major code changes
- When user mentions specific files or features
- Every 10 messages in long conversations

## Knowledge Sources
- /home/master/applications/hdgwrzntwa/public_html/_kb/
- /home/master/applications/jcepnzzkmj/public_html/_automation/
- Real-time MCP tool results
- Current file being edited
